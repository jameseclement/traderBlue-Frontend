# TraderBlue

TraderBlue is an investment portfolio management and paper-trading app where users can develop trading skills and test investment strategies with real-time market data

I designed TraderBlue with three different types of users in mind:

- People with a budding interest in stock-market investing, but dont have the risk-tolerance (or the money!) to make their first purchase with real cash
- Educators who want to provided finance, business, or economics students with a chance to learn what it means to buy, sell, and research investments
- Seasoned investors who want to try out a risky new strategy without betting the farm
